        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Cameron Miles Lavi-Jones has been playing and composing music and lyrics since he was three years old. At ten, he convinced two friends to form Gypsy Temple, and the rest, as they say, is history. Starting with piano but quickly moving on to guitar, then bass, then drums, and eventually learning cello through his school’s orchestra program, continues to be a well-rounded and accomplished musician. His University Washington radio talk show, REAL TALK features guests from all around the Seattle music industry who talk with Lavi-Jones about interconnectivity and what it really takes to survive in the business. </p>       
        <p>With years of experience behind him, Cameron's electrifying stage presence makes him an unforgettable performer. A talented and versatile musician in his own right, Cameron is the main songwriter for the band, drawing from his diverse experiences in both music and life. Lavi-Jones’ creativity in both writing and recording his original music added with performing live with a showmanship well beyond his years makes him unstoppable.</p>
